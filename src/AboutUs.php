	<h1>Meet The Hive:</h1>
	<p><strong>Mission Statement:</strong> Our mission is to provide a platform for novice programmers to learn and master basic programming concepts in popular languages such as Python, Java, JavaScript, C, and C++. We aim to offer a comprehensive learning experience through our website, which includes an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) and a terminal to display user inputted code. Our goal is to educate and empower individuals who want to build a strong foundation in coding. To achieve this, we have included lessons on writing for loops, while loops, arrays, if-then statements, and syntax checkers, so that our users can gain the necessary knowledge and skills to become proficient programmers.</p>

	<p><strong>Origin:</strong> We are The Hive, a team competing in HenHacks. Our team consists of Jake Milburn (left), Michael Zuppas (second from the left), Michael Woods (second from the right), and Nicholas Antrim (right). We were hired as IT interns by John Williams, the head coach of the University of Delaware Men’s Club Crew team, to work for his law firm, IncNow in Wilmington, DE. Despite our varied backgrounds and skill sets, we were able to collaborate and work together effectively on multiple projects and assignments. We quickly discovered that we had a strong ability to solve problems and work together as a team. Our reputation for successfully tackling any challenge that came our way soon followed. Inspired by the concept of a hive mind, in which social insects work together as a single entity, we decided to adopt the name "The Hive" to represent our collaborative approach to problem-solving.</p>
